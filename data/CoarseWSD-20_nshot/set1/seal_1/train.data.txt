20	2012 saw one direction and delta goodrem perform on the night and appearances of flo rida , tony bennett and seal .
4	an inuit hunts the seal and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival .
8	it survives with tags which once attached a seal , now lost .
13	generally speaking , standard ball joints will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break , causing the joint to dry out and rust .
