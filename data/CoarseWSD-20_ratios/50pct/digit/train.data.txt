9	modern electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digit and arithmetical operations .
7	many maintain that it is easier for digit to be reduced or lost during evolution than the reverse , however there is no evidence for this .
25	their mechanical design was very unusual in that their result dials ( sums , differences , and products ) moved at speeds proportional to the digit in the corresponding column of the keyboard .
